*Mentors*: Paul and Joanna

**Hi everyone,
I was wondering: once we complete the Nanodegree and get our certificate, will we still have access to the course material? For some time? Indefinitely?**

*Because the program is a scholarship, you have a hard stop on what you can access. The end date is August 15th.*

**Hi mentors! Awesome to be a part of another AMA. Here's my question: What is the role of our personal mentors (i.e. how much are we allowed to bother them)? Should we still rely on peer help more and discuss only projects with them?  In any case, it's amazing to have guidance!**

*Yes, you will be assigned an in-classroom mentor for the program. You will see you mentor pop up in a chat box once you log-into your classroom. Please utilize your mentor to check-in and set goals. They are an amazing resource! You can message them when you need their guidance, but just keep in mind their responses may not be immediate since they also aid other students :)*

**Will we get a forum for phase two? Feels bad to post in the old one because of all that didn't make it to the second phase. I miss the forum already! Would be nice with a forum with all tracks but with sub-forums within it.**

*It depends on your program. MWS is the only program that does not have forum access Hope that helps!*

**What if i fail to submit the project before the due day? Do i lose the chance to graduate from the Nanodegree??**

*You won't lose access to the ND. These due dates are **highly recommended** guidelines set by our course designers. Historically speaking, students who miss the first deadlines are very likely to not graduate from the ND since the work piles up and can become just too much. We also suggest that you submit the course projects two weeks before the deadline since you'll still need to time to edit your projects and submissions with the feedback you receive so that your project can be approved by the due date.*

**I am in the Android Developer Nanodegree and I can see 2 of the projects (the 2 Pop Movies apps) as already finished because I already did them in a previous scholarship
for the Android Developer Fast Track.
Is this correct or should I resubmit the projects? At the moment there is no possibility for resubmitting these 2 projects in my account.**

*The projects will carry over and have already been submitted.*

**Many application have discount for students we can use that discount to?**

*The coupon is something we generated for the students who were not selected to be in the Scholarship ND. We really wished we could have taken everyone in, but sadly, this was not the case.*

**When the course finishes do we get our certificate shipped? and if so do we have to pay for the shipping?**

*It's a digital certificate*
